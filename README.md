Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning Project
🎯 Problem Solved
Built a machine learning system that detects fraudulent credit card transactions with 86-92% accuracy while minimizing customer disruption.

📊 Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle (284,807 real transactions)

Fraud Rate: 0.172% (492 fraud cases) - Extreme imbalance

Features: 30 anonymized + Time + Amount

Target: Binary (0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud)

⚙️ Technical Implementation
Preprocessing: RobustScaler for Time/Amount features

Imbalance Handling: SMOTE (oversampling) + Undersampling

Models Trained:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest ⭐ BEST PERFORMER

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Isolation Forest (unsupervised)

📈 Key Results
Model	Fraud Caught	False Alarms	AUC-ROC	Business Choice
Random Forest	86%	45% precision	0.983	✅ Recommended
Logistic Regression	92%	6% precision	0.971	❌ Too many false alerts
SVM	92%	5% precision	0.974	❌ Too many false alerts
💰 Business Impact
Money Saved: $20,531 per 98 fraud cases

ROI: 300% return on investment

Customer Impact: 80% reduction in false alarms vs other models

Operational Efficiency: 50 alerts/day per 100K transactions (vs 250-285)

🚀 Deployment Ready
✅ Model saved as .joblib files

✅ Prediction API function created

✅ Risk classification: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

✅ Real-time scoring capability

✅ Business metrics calculator

🎯 Why Random Forest Wins
✅ Best balance: Catches 86% fraud + only 45% false alarms

✅ Financial sense: Positive ROI vs negative for other models

✅ Customer friendly: Minimal legitimate transaction blocking

✅ Production ready: Fast inference, interpretable features

📚 Quick Start
python
# Load and predict
model = joblib.load('best_fraud_detection_model.joblib')
scaler = joblib.load('robust_scaler.joblib')

result = predict_fraud(transaction_data, model, scaler)
# Returns: {'is_fraud': True/False, 'risk_level': 'HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW', 'action': 'BLOCK/REVIEW/PASS'}
